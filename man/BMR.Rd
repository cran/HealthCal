\description{
The BMR function helps to calculate rate of energy expenditure per unit time of a person (Male/Female)

\usage{
BMR(inputdata)
}
\arguments{
  \item{inputdata}{
Input data that includes height, weight and age of a person (male/female)
}
}
\details{
Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the rate of energy expenditure per unit time by endothermic animals at rest. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) of a person can be calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation, also known as the Harris-Benedict principle (1918). The function was created using this Harris-Benedict principle.The amount that should be consumed each day in kilocalories to maintain one's present weight can be calculated by multiplying the predicted BMR value by a factor that reflects the person's level of activity.
}
\value{It returns basal metabolic rate (BMR) with present status for both male and female}
